#+title: Services

A collection docker compose files constituting the services I currently self-host.

- [[file:jellyfin/][Jellyfin]] :: Comfy, private and self-hosted media server.
- [[file:qbittorrent/][qbittorrent]] :: Always online, remote torrent manager.
- [[file:syncthing/][syncthing]] :: Decentralized p2p file sharing.
- [[https://pyload.net/][pyload]] :: Free (as in freedom) direct link download manager.
- [[https://pi-hole.net/][pi-hole]] :: Say no to ads and trackers, on the DNS level.

* Upgrade

To upgrade and rebuild all the images, run:

#+begin_src shell
./upgrade.sh
#+end_src

This script will run the ~upgrade.sh~ on each =service= folder, which is responsible for upgrading each container image.
